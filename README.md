#What is NFT Whitelisting?

NFT whitelisting is a method of locking crypto assets to a specific account. This can be used in lots of ways, but the most common use is to prove that you do actually hold specific crypto assets.

The NFT whitelist system eliminates the need for gas limit values and prevents users from accidentally sending tokens to an address that does not support the ERC721 standard.

Whitelisting also allows projects to restrict who can receive specific tokens. For instance, if an ICO were to run out of tokens for their airdrop campaign and people were still trying to claim their tokens, then the project could then just whitelist the userâ€™s account address and give them the rest of the tokens.
